# SPPU BE 2019 DAA PRACTICAL

This repository contains Python implementations for the following practical assignments:

1. **Fibonacci Number Sequence**
2. **Job Sequencing with Deadlines**
3. **Fractional Knapsack Problem**
4. **0-1 Knapsack Problem**
5. **Binomial Coefficients**
6. **8-Queens Puzzle**

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/VixuxOG/BE-Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms-Practical-Assignments.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd practical-assignments-python
```

3. Run the individual programs:

### Fibonacci Number Sequence

```
python fibonacci_sequence.py
```

- The program will prompt you to enter the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate, and then display the sequence.

### Job Sequencing with Deadlines

```
python job_sequencing.py
```

- The program will prompt you to enter the number of jobs, and then ask for the details of each job (ID, deadline, and profit).
- The program will then output the order in which the jobs should be completed.

### Fractional Knapsack Problem

```
python fractional_knapsack.py
```

- The program will prompt you to enter the number of items, and then ask for the weight and value of each item.
- It will also ask you to enter the capacity of the knapsack.
- The program will then output the maximum total value that can be obtained.

### 0-1 Knapsack Problem

```
python 0-1-knapsack.py
```

- The program will prompt you to enter the number of items, and then ask for the weight and value of each item.
- It will also ask you to enter the capacity of the knapsack.
- The program will then output the maximum total value that can be obtained.

### Binomial Coefficients

```
python binomial_coefficients.py
```

- The program will prompt you to enter the total number of elements (n) and the number of elements to choose (k).
- The program will then output the binomial coefficient C(n, k).

### 8-Queens Puzzle

```
python 8-queens_puzzle.py
```

- The program will prompt you to enter the number of queens to place on the board.
- The program will then output the final configuration of the board with the queens placed.
